🐍 Pyrus: The Totally-Legit Desktop Enhancer™
Because what your desktop really needs is a heart attack in PNG form.

🚨 What Is This?
Pyrus is an absolutely harmless* Python script designed to improve your user experience through the sheer power of confusion and existential dread. With a single click, Pyrus transforms your boring, productive desktop into a slideshow of carefully curated images (that may or may not traumatize you).

* Definition of “harmless” may vary depending on your heart rate.

🧠 How It Works
Launch the script.

It screenshots your desktop and pretends everything is fine.

You click. Like a fool.

Pyrus says, “It’s showtime,” and proceeds to:

Go fullscreen (you can’t escape).

Display a series of images with questionable intentions.

Ignore your feeble attempts to close it (nice try, Alt+F4 nerd).

🖼 Requirements
Python 3.x

pyautogui

Pillow

tkinter (standard with Python)

Nerves of steel

🛑 How To Exit
You can’t.
(Okay fine, you can kill the process manually. If you must.)

⚠️ Disclaimer
This is meant for fun, chaos, and annoying your friends. Do not use this on anyone who doesn’t like jump scares, surprise fullscreen apps, or Python itself.

Use responsibly. Or irresponsibly. I’m not your mom.

🐍 Fun Fact
This program includes absolutely no machine learning, artificial intelligence, or cloud integration.

It’s just good old-fashioned desktop terrorism. Enjoy.
